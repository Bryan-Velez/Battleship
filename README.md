Battleship Game Project




Description-

This project will be a simple boardgame style, battleshipt game. Fairly straight forward, you place your ships on your grid and the computer will randomly do the same.
    (You may switch the ships to a vertical or horizontal position before you place them on your board by pressing the "Rotate" button)
The computer randomizes picks for attacks on your grid and you choose from thier grid looking for a HIT.
    (Hits will be displayed as dark red and Misses will be displayed as grey)
Your turn is first, turns will then alternate back and forth between player and computer.

On the top-left side of the screen you will find text that informs you whos turn it is. As well as an information section that tells you if either you or the computer
miss or hit eachothers ships and if a ship is sunk.

The goal of the game is to look for the opposite player's ships and get as many HITs as possible to sink them.
There are four ships in total:
        1: Destroyer - 2 squares
        2: Cruiser - 3 squares
        3: Submarine - 4 squares
        5: Carrier - 5 squares
Once you sink all the enemy ships, you win the game!




How to Get Started-

Press "Start Game" button to begin only after you have placed your ships on your board. Choose a strategic position for your ships on your side of the board. When you are ready to launch the game and you have your ships in the water, Press "Start Game" to begin.
